        <section id="site_name">
            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h4>Wimberly Chamber of Commerce</h4>
            <p>I chose Wimberly Chamber of Commerce because Wimberly is a
                town not too far where I live in Texas. It is little but
                so much goes on there and I think it would be a good place to
                do this assignment for.</p>

        <section id="site_purpose">
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to be a central hub of information
                about Wimberly and the businesses in that area. It's a good place
                to get your business promoted so that all can see and be involved
                in it also. </p>

            <p>-Is this town a good place to start a business and what types of businesses are already there?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="color_schema">
            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>It is a little town in Texas that is very secluded that feels very friendly and inviting.
                I want there to be duller colors as it blends in with the surroundings of the town.
                I was thinking tan for the background of the pages with some blues and greens. I want there
                to be dark words for the information on the pages to help brighten the page. I think I want
                the heading at the top a cream color, the nav bar to be blue, and the background to be tan.
                I will implement a dark green in there to help with the light and darks contrast. </p>

        <section id="typography">
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The fonts I have chosen to use is Open Sans for the simplicity of it. I also want to in others
                for things such as titles and headers to add a little more detail. I have not come up with one
                to use but I will add it when I do.
